# Expo Image Loading Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in an Expo React Native project where an image from the `assets` folder fails to load.  The image file is correctly included, but the image does not appear in the app. This example highlights the problem and provides a working solution.

## Bug Description
The `App.js` file attempts to load an image from the `assets` folder using the `require()` method. Despite the correct path being specified, the image remains unrendered, resulting in a blank area on the screen.  This is unexpected behavior and points to a potential issue in the project setup or image handling within Expo.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying that the image is correctly included in the project's asset bundle and ensuring that the `require()` path is accurate. In some cases, clearing the Expo cache or rebuilding the project might be necessary.
